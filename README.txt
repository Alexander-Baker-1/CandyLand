ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project implements an interactive board game fashioned after the game
Candy Land. The game can be played with a miniumum of two players and a 
maximum of eight players. As players traverse the world of Candy Land, they 
will come across hidden treasures and traps with twists and turns along the 
way. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get to the Candy Castle 
at the end of the board.
